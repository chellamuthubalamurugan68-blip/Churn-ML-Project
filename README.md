Churn ML Project

This project applies machine learning to predict customer churn, helping businesses identify customers at risk of leaving. Using structured data, it analyzes behavioral and demographic features, builds predictive models, and provides insights to improve customer retention.

🔍 Project Overview

Preprocesses churn dataset (cleaning, encoding, feature scaling).

Explores relationships between customer attributes and churn.

Trains ML models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.

Evaluates performance with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

📊 Key Insights

Features like age, credit score, and tenure impact churn likelihood.

Class imbalance affects model performance and requires attention.

Random Forest and SVM provide strong predictive results.

🚀 Results

The project demonstrates how churn prediction enables proactive retention strategies by flagging at-risk customers before they leave.
